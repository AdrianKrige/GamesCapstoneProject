# Gameplay
Neo Divitias is a two-player platformer-shooter in which players must co-operate in order to advance through various levels. Players gather energy from destroyed enemies and collected objectives, which can be used to purchase powerful equipment from an arsenal of four weapons, two movement abilities and a health upgrade. At the end of the game, players are turned against each other and must face off in a first-to-three duel, gaining points for either capturing the objective zone or killing the other player.
